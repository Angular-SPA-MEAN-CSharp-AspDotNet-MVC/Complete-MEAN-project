<h2> This project is planned to complete a MEAN stack project. </h2>
<h4> --- Currently working on APIs. Partially done.</h4>
The data come from a MongoDb, via mLab.

The APIs are built via NodeJS and Express framework.

In addition, the Single Page Application is built via Angular 6/7.




To execute this project, it needs to install the following node modules : ExpressJS, MongoDb, body-parser, and so on.

Also, it is suggested to install nodemon. So that, the API can restart you server when file changes.



<h4>The project is under construction now.</h4>
